This code was inspired by a StackOverflow question:

http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13210827/activity-and-intent-service-communication-broken-after-screen-rotate/14993420#14993420

It still contains at least one major hack: random number generation completely hangs the IntentService daemon thread.  I was trying to solve the problem while changing as little as possible.

Just FYA.
